Organic browser is a browser just like any other browser, but with one special feature, downloading webpages.Organic browser is for windows only, it was built using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF). 
This browser enables you to download websites and view them without internet connection. It downloads the website's HTML, then extracts all the resources (images, styles, etc...) from the HTML and downloads it. That's basically how the browser downloads pages.

## Features

 - **Downloading webpages**: This browser enables you to download web pages and view them 
 later even if you do not have access to the internet
 - **Multiple tabs**: You can open multiple tabs that will work simultaneously
 - **Standart Browser functions:** Simple operations such as going back, going forward, refresh and much more.
 - **Modularity:** Organic browser is very modular, as the user you can change home page,

 - **Moden Design:** Every little button, page, option in the browser has a lot of thinking behind it in terms of design.
