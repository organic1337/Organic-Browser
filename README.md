Organic browser is a browser just like any other browser, but with one special feature, downloading webpages.Organic browser is for windows only, it was built using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF). 
This browser enables you to download websites and view them without internet connection. It downloads the website's HTML, then extracts all the resources (images, styles, etc...) from the HTML and downloads it. That's basically how the browser downloads pages.
